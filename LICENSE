# Community Free Resource License

**1\. Scope.** This Community Free Resource License (“License”) governs the downloadable resource (“Resource”) available on the website that links to this License. By downloading the applicable resource, you agree to the terms of this License. This License forms an agreement between the person downloading the resource (“you”) and the person or entity listed at the creator of the Resource (“Creator”). If you are using the Resources on behalf of an entity (such as your employer), you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to this License. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.

**2\. License.** Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this License, Creator grants to you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right during your subscription to the Figma software platform provided by Figma, Inc. (the “Figma Platform”) to install and use the Resources, solely in connection with your authorized use of the Figma Platform

**3\. Restrictions.** Except as may be expressly permitted by applicable law, you will not, and will not permit, authorize, or direct third parties to:

a. rent, lease, or otherwise permit third parties to use the Resources;

b. circumvent or disable any security or other technological features or measures of the Resources;

c. reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, know-how, or algorithms relevant to the Resources;

d. modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Resources; or

e. remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Resources.

**4.** WARRANTY WAIVER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT LEGALLY POSSIBLE, THE RESOURCE IS MADE AVAILABLE AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND CREATOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE RESOURCE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. TO THE EXTENT LEGALLY POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE CREATOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE RESOURCE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE NOT ALLOWED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER AND/OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU; HOWEVER, THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVIDED ABOVE SHALL BE INTERPRETED IN A MANNER THAT, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, MOST CLOSELY APPROXIMATES AN ABSOLUTE DISCLAIMER AND WAIVER OF ALL LIABILITY.

**5\. Termination**. If you fail to comply with the terms of this License, then your rights to use the Resource automatically and immediately terminate. Upon termination you will delete all copies of the Resources and all derivatives thereof. Sections 4, 5, and 6 shall survive any termination of this License.

**6\. Other Arrangements.** Nothing herein shall prevent you and Creator from entering into your own separate agreement regarding the Resources.
